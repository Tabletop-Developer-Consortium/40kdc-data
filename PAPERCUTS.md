# Papercuts

Small repository frictions recorded while doing real work.

## 2026-08-05T17:38:48Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

A remembered .claude/skills/dsl-campaign path was absent in the current workspace, causing a parallel inspection batch to fail before returning independent results.

## 2026-08-05T19:17:02Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

jj status refused to snapshot a 39.9 MiB untracked session HTML file, adding repeated warning noise and preventing a clean workspace snapshot.

## 2026-08-05T21:39:11Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Browser request interception did not surface EventSource stream requests, so the documented interception path could not drive staged SSE commits and required a localhost fixture server instead.

## 2026-08-05T22:07:50Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

The required killport helper is unavailable, so a failed combined-server launch could not use the mandated port cleanup command.

## 2026-08-06T00:54:08Z — openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol

Browser open waited on Vite networkidle0 and timed out because the dev UI keeps a connection open; the tab may still be usable, but the error obscures that state.
